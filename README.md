## P2P Marketplace
This project was created as part of an introduction to web development course. This project was developed by four people and was completed in approximately one week. Due to this, there is still plenty of room for improvement. My future plans include refactoring and making enhancements, during which I aim to deepen my knowledge of JavaScript, TypeScript, and web development.

### My role in this project was:
- "Team lead"
- Frontend: desing of webside
- Prezentation of projekt

### Technologies:
- React
- Typesript
- Tailwind
- Prisma

#### There is a lot of space for improvement, for example:
- one folder with api models
- better decomposition of frontend components
- better work with Tailwind
- some more interesting logic at backend
